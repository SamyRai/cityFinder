# Nearest City Finder for Go

A high-performance Go library to find the nearest city based on geographical coordinates using the S2 Geometry Library.

## Features

- **Efficient Nearest City Search**: Uses the S2 Geometry Library to provide fast and accurate nearest city searches.
- **Low Memory Consumption**: Optimized for low memory usage.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integrating into your Go projects.
- **Support for Postal Codes**: Find cities based on postal codes.

## Why S2?

The S2 Geometry Library is chosen for its superior performance and efficiency in handling geographical data. This library uses `s2.ShapeIndex` to store geographical points as a `s2.PointVector`, which allows for highly efficient spatial indexing.

Nearest neighbor searches are performed using `s2.NewClosestEdgeQuery`, which leverages the spatial index to find the closest points with remarkable speed. This approach provides:
- **Hierarchical Spatial Indexing**: Efficiently manages and queries large sets of geographical points.
- **High Precision**: Ensures accurate results by calculating geodesic distances on the sphere.
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Uses memory efficiently, making it suitable for applications with limited resources.

## Performance

The S2 implementation has been significantly refactored for improved performance and accuracy. New benchmarks are currently being generated to reflect these enhancements. The results will be updated here as soon as they are available.

## Installation

To install the library, use `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/SamyRai/cityFinder
```

## Usage

### Finding the Nearest City

To find the nearest city based on latitude and longitude:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/SamyRai/cityFinder/lib/finder"
    "github.com/SamyRai/cityFinder/lib/config"
    "github.com/SamyRai/cityFinder/lib/initializer"
)

func main() {
    cfg, err := config.LoadConfig("config.json")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to load config: %v", err)
    }

    cityFinder, err := initializer.Initialize(cfg)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Initialization failed: %v", err)
    }
	
    // Find the nearest city
    nearestCity, distance, err := cityFinder.FindNearestCity(40.7128, -74.0060) // New York coordinates
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to find nearest city: %v", err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Nearest city: %s, %s\n", nearestCity.Name, nearestCity.Country)
    fmt.Printf("Distance: %.2f km\n", distance)
}
```

### Finding a City by Postal Code

To find a city based on postal code:

```go
// Assuming cityFinder is initialized as shown above
nearestCity := cityFinder.FindCityByPostalCode("10001", "US")

if nearestCity != nil {
    fmt.Printf("City for postal code: %s, %s\n", nearestCity.Name, nearestCity.Country)
} else {
    log.Println("No city found for the given postal code")
}
```

## Running the Server

The package also includes a server that provides an API for finding the nearest city and querying cities by name or postal code.

### Building the Server

To build the server, use the following command:

```bash
go build -o nearestcityserver cmd/server/main.go
```

### Running the Server

To run the server, execute the built binary:

```bash
./nearestcityserver
```

By default, the server will listen on port 3000.

### API Endpoints

- **Find Nearest City**: `/nearest?lat=<latitude>&lon=<longitude>`
- **Find City by Name**: `/coordinates?name=<city_name>`
- **Find City by Postal Code**: `/postalcode?postalcode=<postal_code>&country=<country_code>`

## Testing

Unit tests are included for the core S2 finder logic. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
go test -v ./lib/finder/coordinates/
```

## Initialization and Datasets

This project requires datasets from the [GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/) database. Specifically, you need the `allCountries.txt` for city data and `allCountries.zip` for postal code data. These files should be placed in the `datasets` folder.

During initialization, the application checks if these datasets and the S2 index are available. If they are not, it downloads and extracts the required datasets and builds the S2 index. This ensures that the necessary data is always available regardless of how the library is used.

### Using the Server

The server can be started using the following command:

```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```
